title: How to implement Distributed Locks with Redis
date: 2022-08-11T07:36:08.760Z
summary: For single-process concurrency scenarios, you can use the locks
  provided by the programming language and corresponding class libraries, such
  as the Synchronized syntax in Java and the ReentrantLock class, to avoid
  concurrency problems. If in a distributed scenario, to achieve simultaneous
  access to code and resources by threads of different clients and to ensure the
  security of processing shared data under multiple threads, distributed lock
  technology is required.

For the single-process concurrency scenario, you can use the lock provided by the programming language and the corresponding class library, such as the `Synchronized` syntax and the `ReentrantLock` class in Java, to avoid concurrency problems.

If in a distributed scenario, implements the simultaneous access of code and resources by threads of different clients, guarantees the security of processing shared data under multithreading, then needs Use distributed lock technology.

Distributed lock is a lock implementation that controls distributed systems or different systems to access shared resources. If a resource is shared between different systems or different hosts in the same system , Mutual exclusion is often required to prevent interference with each other to ensure consistency.
