summary: In the process of preparing for the internship, the author learned a
  lot from the open source community, such as knowing the blogs of many bigwigs
  ( [Halfrost's Field | Frostland](https://halfrost.com/) ), and building my own
  knowledge base ( [Ricear's Notebook](https://www.ricear.com/) ).
  Therefore, I want to deposit this knowledge and give back to the community. On
  the one hand, you can not only deepen your understanding of these knowledge,
  but on the other hand, you can also communicate with other small partners to
  learn and make progress together.

## Why write this open source book

In the process of preparing for the internship, the author learned a lot from the open source community, such as knowing the blogs of many bigwigs ( [Halfrost's Field | Frostland](https://halfrost.com/) ), and building my own knowledge base ( [Ricear's Notebook](https://www.ricear.com/) ). Therefore, I want to deposit this knowledge and give back to the community. On the one hand, you can not only deepen your understanding of these knowledge, but on the other hand, you can also communicate with other small partners to learn and make progress together.

## About the cover

[The cover picture](https://unsplash.com/photos/Qb7D1xw28Co?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditShareLink) is a cute üê∂ with calm eyes and calm eyes. Only when we are prepared can we know what to do and take it easy.

The meaning of the cover title is "The Road to Computer School Recruitment", which means that this book is mainly suitable for students who participate in post-practice school recruitment for back-end development related positions.

The color of the cover theme is yellow, which is the color of "Harvest üåæ". I hope this book can wish you all üí™ and üé† success.

The text at the bottom of the cover reads "The road is long, but the journey is near. Heaven rewards diligence, and the accumulation of wealth will make little progress.‚Äù " [Most people overestimate what they can do in a day and underestimate what they can do in a year](https://github.com/wolverinn/Waking-Up) ." Only when we are down-to-earth and keep accumulating can we calmly deal with opportunities when they come.

## Instructions for use

* There is a search bar in the upper left corner of this e-book, which can quickly help you find the chapter and title number you want to read.
* This e-book is suitable for students who want to have an in-depth understanding of the knowledge points, and then summarize and summarize according to their own understanding to deal with the interview. It is not suitable for students who want to go to the interview directly by memorizing, because the [interviewer likes to Continuous and in-depth questioning on a question makes it easy to screen out candidates who have just tried it](https://imageslr.com/2021/autumn-recruit.html) . [We should have a solid grasp of each knowledge point, rather than aiming to cover more interview questions. Focus on quality rather than weight, focus on depth rather than breadth, and gradually build a personal knowledge system](https://imageslr.com/2021/autumn-recruit.html) .
